# Financial-Forensics-Agent 🚀

Financial-Forensics-Agent is a Python-based toolkit for analyzing old shareholding certificates and investigating the current status and value of historical company shares. It leverages Google GenAI (Gemini), yfinance, and FastMCP to automate extraction, validation, and valuation of legacy financial documents.

## 📝 What does it do?

1. **Extracts Data from Share Certificates:**  
   Uses Google GenAI to process scanned images of old share certificates and extract key fields (company name, shareholder, issue date, number of shares).

2. **Checks Company Status:**  
   Uses a custom tool (with Google Search via Gemini) to determine if the company is still active, has merged, been acquired, or dissolved, and fetches the latest ticker and relevant info.

3. **Estimates Share Value:**  
   If the company is still listed, fetches the latest share price from NSE (via yfinance) and estimates the total value of the shares.

4. **Returns a Human-Readable Report:**  
   Summarizes findings and action items for the user.

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Set up your Google GenAI API Key

Edit both `server.py` and `client.py` and replace the empty string in `genai.Client(api_key="")` with your actual API key.

### 2. Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```
- The server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8050` and exposes tools for company status checking and share value estimation.

### 3. Run the Client

- Place a scanned share certificate image as `test_image.jpg` in the project directory (or modify the path in `client.py`).
- Run:

```bash
python client.py
```
- The client will:
  - Extract data from the image using Gemini.
  - Connect to the server and use the available tools.
  - Print a structured report with findings.
